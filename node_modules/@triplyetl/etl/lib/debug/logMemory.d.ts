 * This is a debug tool that prints the memory usage of an Etl to the terminal.
 * This can also be written to disk which is useful when debugging OOM issues.
 * Post processing of the stats can also be used to create graphs of the memory usage over the ETL.
 * Info written to disk is using json lines format.
 *
 * *note: if you want to print to console and write to disk you can insert 2 logMemory MW, one that prints, another with destination.
 *
 * @param logOnRecord number : print or write stats every N number of records. Defaults to every record.
 * @param destination string (path of directory) : writes full memory usage stats to the given path.
 * *note: If you use the destination argument you will not print to console.
 * @returns void
