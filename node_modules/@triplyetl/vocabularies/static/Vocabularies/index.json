    "description": "The BIO vocabulary contains terms useful for finding out more about people and their backgrounds and has some cross-over into genealogical information.  The approach taken is to describe a person's life as a series of interconnected key events, around which other information can be woven.  This vocabulary defines the event framework and supplies a set of core event types that cover many use cases, but it is expected that it will be extended in other vocabularies to suit their needs.  The intention of this vocabulary is to describe biographical events of people and this intention carries through to the definitions of the properties and classes which are person-centric rather than neutral.  For example the Employment event puts the person being employed as the principal agent in the event rather than the employer.\n\nAt its heart the BIO vocabulary is concerned with people, their relationships and the events in their lives.  Together these can be used to build up a narrative of a person's life and their interactions with other people, organizations and the world around them.  Events bound intervals of time that may be associated with particular relationships between people and groups or organisations.  Many different types of life event are defined in this vocabulary including the obvious Birth, Marriage and Death but also Coronation, Performance and even Murder.  These events are not intended to be fully comprehensive but are representative of the types of events associated with biographical material.  Currently the relationship segment of the vocabulary is underspecified with only a generic Relationship class available.  It is envisaged that many types of relationship such as families, employments and ownerships will be specified in the future.\n\nThe sequence of events and intervals build a timeline of history against which people and their relationships can be placed.  The aim is to enable simple forms of genealogical reasoning such as determining whether a child was born out of wedlock or the location of a family given the fact one of their children was attending a particular school.  Events are ordered in time by relating them to one another and to abstract intervals of time.\n\nVersion: 0.1.0",

Its primary purpose is facilitating the management, integration, mediation, interchange and access to research data by description of semantic relationships, in particular causal ones. It is not primarily a model to process the data themselves in order to produce new research results, even though its representations offer themselves to be used for some kind of processing.\n\nCRMsci uses and extends the CIDOC CRM (ISO21127) as a general ontology of human activity, things and events happening in spacetime. It uses the same encoding-neutral formalism of knowledge representation (“data model” in the sense of computer science) as the CIDOC CRM, which can be implemented in RDFS, OWL, on RDBMS and in other forms of encoding. Since the model reuses, wherever appropriate, parts of CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, we provide in this document also a comprehensive list of all constructs used from ISO21127, together with their definitions following the version 6.2  maintained by CIDOC.\n\n\nWhat is the idea?\n\nThe CRMsci has been developed bottom up from specific metadata examples from biodiversity, geology, archeology, cultural heritage conservation and clinical studies, such as water sampling in aquifer systems, earthquake shock recordings, landslides, excavation processes, species occurrence and detection of new species, tissue sampling in cancer research, 3D digitization, based on communication with the domain experts and the implementation and validation in concrete applications. It takes into account relevant standards, such as INSPIRE, OBOE, national archeological standards for excavation, Digital Provenance models and others. For each application, another set of extensions is needed in order to describe those data at an adequate level of specificity, such as semantics of excavation layers or specimen capture in biology. However, the model presented here describes, together with the CIDOC CRM, a discipline neutral level of genericity, which can be used to implement effective management functions and powerful queries for related data. It aims at providing superclasses and superproperties for any application-specific extension, such that any entity referred to by a compatible extension can be reached with a more general query based on this model.\n\nCRMsci is a proposal for approval by CIDOC CRM  SIG",

A GML document is described using a GML Schema.  This allows users and developers to describe generic geographic data sets that contain points, lines and polygons.  However, the developers of GML envision communities working to define community-specific [application schemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GML_Application_Schemas) that are specialized extensions of GML.  Using application schemas, users can refer to roads, highways, and bridges instead of points, lines and polygons.  If everyone in a community agrees to use the same schemas they can exchange data easily and be sure that a road is still a road when they view it.  Clients and servers with interfaces that implement the OpenGIS® [Web Feature Service Interface Standard](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs) read and write GML data.

    "description": "The QUDT, or “Quantity, Unit, Dimension and Type” schema defines the base classes properties, and restrictions used for modeling physical quantities, units of measure, and their dimensions in various measurement systems.  The goal of the QUDT ontology is to provide a unified model of, measurable quantities, units for measuring different kinds of quantities, the numerical values of quantities in different units of measure and the data structures and data types used to store and manipulate these objects in software.\n\nExcept for unit prefixes, all units are specified in separate vocabularies.  Descriptions are provided in both HTML and LaTeX formats.  A quantity is a measure of an observable phenomenon, that, when associated with something, becomes a property of that thing; a particular object, event, or physical system.\n\nA quantity has meaning in the context of a measurement (i.e. the thing measured, the measured value, the accuracy of measurement, etc.) whereas the underlying quantity kind is independent of any particular measurement.  Thus, length is a quantity kind while the height of a rocket is a specific quantity of length; its magnitude that may be expressed in meters, feet, inches, etc.  Or, as stated at Wikipedia, in the language of measurement, quantities are quantifiable aspects of the world, such as time, distance, velocity, mass, momentum, energy, and weight, and units are used to describe their measure.  Many of these quantities are related to each other by various physical laws, and as a result the units of some of the quantities can be expressed as products (or ratios) of powers of other units (e.g., momentum is mass times velocity and velocity is measured in distance divided by time).\n\nVersion: 2.1.2",
