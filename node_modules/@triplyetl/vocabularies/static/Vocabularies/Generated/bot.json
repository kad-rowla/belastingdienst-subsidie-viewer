This includes one-dimensional (surface) heat losses from one zone to another through a single building element, a two dimensional (line) loss from one zone to another through the connection in which the two elements meet or a three dimensional (point) loss from one zone to another through the connection where three elements (typically two walls and a slab) meet.     - Connection of an electric device to the electric system of a building.     - A door between one room and another."

A bot:Storey is contained in one or more buildings, and is intended to contain one or more spaces that are horizontally connected. Storeys of a building are connected by means of vertical connections such as elevators and stairs.

An instance of bot:Zone can contain other bot:Zone instances, making it possible to group or subdivide zones. An instance of bot:Zone can be adjacent to or intersecting other bot:Zone instances.
