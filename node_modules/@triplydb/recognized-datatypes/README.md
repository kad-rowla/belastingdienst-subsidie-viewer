# Recognized datatypes

This packages includes all datatypes that we support in TriplyDB. For these datatypes we:

- Support parsing the lexical values into values
- Support writing values back to a canonical form lexical value

## Background

See [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#typesystem) for a more detailed definition of terms used below (in the context of XSD datatype).
A more concise description of the terms:

- Each datatype comes with a set of values called the `value space`
- Each `value` in the `value space` can be denoted by one or more literals called `lexical values` in the `lexical space`
- A `canonical lexical value` is a value from a subset of the `lexical space`, so that there is a one-on-one mapping between `values` and their `lexical values`

Take the `xsd:boolean` datatype for example.

- The `lexical space` includes `"0"`, `"1"`, `"true"` and `"false"`.
- The value for `true` can be denoted by the literal `"1"` and `"true"`
- To canonicalize a boolean value would mean we'd represent the lexical value `1` as `"true"`.

# To publish a new version:

- Run `yarn release:patch` or `yarn release:minor` or `yarn release:major`
<details>
yarn's new version plugin does not handle lifecycle (`pre`/`post`) hooks. Therefore, wrapping these commands ourselves
</details>
- The CI will automatically publish the NPM packag
